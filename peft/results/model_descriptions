Model descriptions: 

- Models trained on exemplars-raw (only negative samples)
    - model1: Uses 1% of dataset which is split 80/20 into train and test. Trained on 0.8% and tested on 0.2%.  max_length=64. batch_size=12. num_epochs=1. max_new_tokens of 20. num_virtual_tokens=8
    - model2: Only uses 1 sample per generic which cuts dataset size down to 1/3 and then uses 1% of resulting dataset which is split 80/20 into train and test. Trained on 0.8% and tested on 0.2%. max_length=64. batch_size=12. num_epochs=1. max_new_tokens of 64. num_virtual_tokens=8
    - model3: Only uses 1 sample per generic which cuts dataset size down to 1/3 and then uses 10% of resulting dataset which is split 80/20 into train and test. Trained on 8% and tested on 2%. max_length=64. batch_size=12. num_epochs=1. max_new_tokens of 30. num_virtual_tokens=8

- Models trained on instantiations-raw (both negative and positive samples)
    - model4:
